# 🌍 AI Travel Agent with CrewAI and Ollama 🌟

Welcome to the AI Travel Agent project, powered by CrewAI and Ollama! This repository showcases the development of an innovative MVP for Online Travel Agencies (OTAs), allowing users to search for unique stays using detailed descriptions and receive personalized recommendations and itineraries. 🏡✈️

## 🚀 Project Overview

Traditional OTAs like MakeMyTrip and Booking often limit users to specific filters and search parameters. Our goal is to provide an unrestricted search experience where users can express their unique travel needs and receive customized suggestions.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Personalized Search**: Use detailed descriptions to find the perfect stay.
  - Example: "A secluded stay by a riverside within 200 km from Bangalore, with high-speed Wi-Fi and parking."
  - Example: "A homestay right on the beach in Goa, within 3000 rupees per night."

- **AI-Powered Recommendations**: Get tailored travel options based on your inputs.

- **Detailed Itineraries**: Receive comprehensive travel itineraries based on selected stays and user interests.

## 🤖 How It Works

1. **Intent Mapper Agent**: Extracts key details from the user's travel query.
2. **Finder Agent**: Searches for suitable travel recommendations.
3. **Formatter Agent**: Formats the recommendations for the user.
4. **Itinerary Maker Agent**: Creates detailed travel itineraries.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **CrewAI**: A framework for orchestrating role-playing, autonomous AI agents.
- **Ollama**: Powers the AI agents with advanced capabilities.
